# UFFT
Introducing UFFT - The Unprivate Fortnite Tracker Tool. I created this website using HTML/CSS (Tailwind) and JavaScript to assist Fortnite eSports players in evaluating the true statistics of potential teammates. With over 20,000+ monthly users, this tool has become a go-to resource for players looking to make informed decisions and eliminate uncertainty about their teammates' skill level(s). No more uncertainty about the skill level of your teammates.
